In cybersecurity, triage involves analyzing incoming alerts or security incidents, determining their criticality, and deciding the order in which they should be addressed. The goal of triage is to allocate limited resources effectively to the most pressing issues, ensuring a prompt and efficient resolution. Communication and collaboration are integral to the process, as they enable teams to share information and make informed decisions quickly.

In cybersecurity Communication and collaboration among team members are critical to the efficiency of the triage process, especially in high-stakes environments like cybersecurity. A well-coordinated team ensures the prompt sharing of information about potential security incidents, enabling real-time awareness and swift decision-making. Collaborative tools and platforms play a vital role in facilitating the quick exchange of alerts, threat intelligence, and observations, ensuring all team members are aligned on the situation. This collective approach not only accelerates response times but also enhances the accuracy of assessments and prioritizations, ultimately strengthening the overall incident response process.
