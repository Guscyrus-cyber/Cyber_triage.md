**Triage in everyday life**

I think Communication and collaboration among team members play crucial
roles in the efficiency of the triage process, particularly in contexts
like healthcare, IT support, emergency response, cybersecurity, or any
situation where prioritizing and responding to issues rapidly is
essential. For example, in cybersecurity, there should be a prompt and
effective response to security incidents. The triage process, which
involves the initial assessment and prioritization of security events,
greatly benefits from a well-coordinated team effort. Team members need
to share information about potential security incidents in real-time.
Collaborative tools and platforms facilitate quick sharing of alerts,
threat intelligence, and observations. This ensures that the entire team
is aware of ongoing incidents, allowing for faster response times during
the triage process.

Managing stress during high pressure, I try to be calm by taking a deep
breath and focusing during the triage process. The best strategy is to
break down tasks into smaller, manageable steps prioritize them, and
then Communicate effectively with team members and seek support. Open
communication within the incident response team fosters collaboration.
Sharing insights, findings, and concerns helps distribute the workload
and ensures that multiple perspectives contribute to the triage process.
